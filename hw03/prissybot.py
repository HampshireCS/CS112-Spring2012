CS112 Homework 3:   PrissyBot

Prissy bot, the rude chat bot, is just mean!  It does not listen, asks obnoxious questions, and says anything it likes.
"""

# Step 1:
# -----------------------
# Program the following.
# 
#    $ python prissybot.py
#    Enter your name:  Paul
#   
#    PrissyBot: Hello there, Paul
#    Paul: hi bot
#    PrissyBot: You mean, "hi bot, sir!"
# 
# Make sure the user inputs their own name and responses.



# Step 2:
# -----------------------
# Keep adding to the conversation. Make sure that your program 
# includes the following:
# 
#  * get and use input from the user
#  * 3 math problems
#     * at least one should get numbers from the user
#  * at least 3 insults


# Advanced
# -------------------------
# Make sure your prissy bot uses string formatting throughout.  
# Also, create new programs for the following:
#  
#  1. draw some kind of ascii art based on user input
#  2. print a decimal/binary/hexidecimal conversion table 
#     * well formated and labeled
#     * reads 5 numbers from the input (all less than 256)
#  3. reduce a fraction
#     * read a numerator and denominator from the user
#     * ex.  6/4 = 1 2/4
